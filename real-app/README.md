# Simple Real Application:
>_This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application implemented in the language._

## Inside this project:
> - A program that creates a calculator using an open source library in Kotlin
> - The open source Library used is called Tornadofx
> - This project also uses one of the build tools that Kotlin supports

# The Library Used:
> - Name: Tornadofx
> - Description: JavaFX Framework for Kotlin
> - Link to the Git Repo: https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx

## Build Tool Used:
> - Gradle is used in this projects

## Issues:
> - Since Java11 removed the javafx library from its jdk, Ive had to revert back to java 8 to run this code
> - The newest version of Kotlin ```1.3.11``` is not supported on java 8 so I've had to revert to using Koltin 1.2.21
