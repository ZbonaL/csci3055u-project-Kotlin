## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> ### _History_
> - Kotlin was released on Febuary 15 2016, it was designed by a team at Jetbrains to be used as an alternative to programming Adroid apps in java, just like how switf is used in programming apps on IOS

>  ### _Some interesting features:_
> - Its an easy language to learn
> - It uses the Java Virtual Machine to compile its code
> - It has similar syntax to both java and javascript
> - Its used heavily in the development of Android applications

## About the syntax

> _This is an example of a Collection in Kotlin_

*Collection*

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) { 
   //mutable List
    val mutablelist: MutableList<Int> = mutableListOf(2, 3, 5)

    // immutable list
    val immutablelist: List<Int> = mutablelist

    println("my mutable list: "+mutablelist)        // prints "[2, 3, 5]"

    // adds 4 to the mutable list
    mutablelist.add(4)

    println("my mutable list after adding new number: "+mutablelist)        // prints "[2, 3, 5, 4]"
    println(immutablelist)
}
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.

> ### _IDE's_
> - Jetbrains IDEA offers a good enviroment to write Kotlin code in
> - Android Studio also offers an enviroment to compile Kotlin code but its only used to develop android applications
> - Visual Studio also can be used to write Kotlin code

> ### _Compilers_
> There is a standalone compiler that can be run

> ### _Build Tools_


## About the standard library
